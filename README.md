# The Hangman
 Game of the classic game "The Hangman"!

## Description

The Hangman is a guessing game for one or more players. One player (or the computer) thinks of a word, phrase, or sentence and the player(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers within a certain number of guesses. Originally a paper-and-pencil game, there are now electronic versions like this one.

# Technology used

This project was written in Python using Wonderwords to generate random words.

## Key Learnings

In this challenge, I learned how to clean the Python console, as well as deepened in the use of loops and conditionals.

It was also fun to set a graphical environment using exclusively written characters and emojis, and to learn how to work with Wonderwords!
